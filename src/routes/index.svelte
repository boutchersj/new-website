        For the rest of you, hi, I'm Steven! Thanks for stopping by!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        During my time in tech, I've worn a few hats, including customer support, manual software testing, frontend development, 
        interviewing, onboarding, mentoring, and documentation writing. I'm always down for learning new things at work, and I've become 
        a fan of adding to my company's internal wiki documentation to help with onboarding new QA Engineers and make it easier 
        for my coworkers to acquire new skills.

        Outside of work, my wife, Sam & I have 2 adorable kitty cats named Minnie & Sadie, and we love to travel, cook, go to the movies, and try new things together. 
        We saw Seattle and Las Vegas for the first time on our honeymoon, and 5 months later we took our first overseas trip to Spain 
        to visit Sevilla and Granada!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Fun fact: Sam and I started together on the customer support team at Fetch Rewards, but we didn't meet there!
