            Today I started to notice more cravings. I went to Woodman's in the morning to get some raspberries and sugar-free gummi worms. 
            During the work day, I didn't have as many veggies or as much water as I could've, and I ate at least 1 more food item than I normally 
            would've on a typical day. I also had Culver's after work, but no sweets, just chicken tenders and cheese curds. I had to miss out on 
            the honey mustard cup I got with it because after looking up the nutrition facts, I learned that it had 18g of sugar, which is absurd to me.

            Overall, I'm still feeling good about this decision. I think I might've eaten more today and since it was my rest day, I didn't work out. 
            It makes sense to me that my weight went back up on Thursday morning because of that, since some of my food choices were bound to 
            introduce some inflammation or water retention, too. I'm finding that it's easier to eat salty foods in place of sugary ones, which is helping 
            with cravings. Even so, I think the secret here is going to be more veggies and protein because they're the most satiating.
