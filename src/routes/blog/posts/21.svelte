            Today was another big eating day without any exercise or PT! I've been feeling a bit under 
            the weather this weekend and it's making me not want to go outside in the cold to run or bike. And 
            I'm more in the mood to nap than exercise indoors, so, it is what it is. The largest meal I had today 
            was 2000 calories: homemade dutch oven mac n cheese, which is super-high in protein. Hit my protein goal, but 
            went 1000 calories over my calorie goal. I'd be shocked if this didn't show up on the scale tomorrow given 
            my low activity level.
