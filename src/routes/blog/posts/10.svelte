            I went jogging in the morning and ate well all day! No surprise there. I also went for a mountain bike 
            ride on my lunch on the Trek trails -- by myself! It was another great cardio workout. It was my rest day 
            for my strength workouts, so that's all I did for exercise. I had some Rx bars, no-sugar high-protein cereal, 
            and a salad during the day. Also some cottage cheese.

            I did happen to have a small crash on my mountain bike while out on the trails, and I was forced to choose between falling 
            with my bike or jumping into a parkour roll away from my bike, and I chose the latter. I ended up taking a lesser portion of the 
            fall impact on my bad knee, which inflamed it for the rest of the day. Spoiler alert: the next morning, it was back to normal. 
            Still, that was a bummer. Kinda felt cool to save my bacon with a parkour move, though. It's not the first time!

            This drop down to 233 is the most progress I've made since starting the blog! A whole 5 pounds lost in the first 10 days of this 
            challenge. I'm excited to see if the trend & velocity continues along the same lines.
