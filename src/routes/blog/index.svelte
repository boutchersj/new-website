            So, I thought it would be clever to make an acronym out of this challenge.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I've been struggling with sugar most of my life. Actually, that's a lie. I 
            didn't <i>struggle</i> with it until I knew I needed to stop eating so much of it. 
            I've honestly loved sugar as long as I can remember. From Culver's custard to Oreos and gummi peach rings, 
            I've tried a lot of different treats over the years. I long considered myself a "candy connoisseur".
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Alas, my body blessed me with the resilience of my youth, only to betray me in my early 20s with 
            the formation of my first gut. I actually <i>lost</i> my "freshman 15" when I was in college, 
            only to <i>gain</i> my first 30 pounds of stress weight in my 4th year. I'm sure it had something to do with work, 
            almost not finishing my 4-year degree, and the relationship I was in at the time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Then I gained some "happiness" weight when I met my now-wife in my 5th & final year of college. I believe I added another 30 
            by the time I started seeing a nutritionist to start addressing the root cause of my weight gain: sweets. I tried a multitude of 
            strategies, diets, exercise regimens, and none of them seemed to stick.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            All in all, I ended up ballooning from 200 lbs. in 2016 to 255 lbs. at my peak in 2022. I became deeply unsatisfied with 
            my inability to continue doing some of the parkour movements I used to enjoy. I'd let myself go to an extent that I couldn't 
            push or pull my body as I once could. I wanted a way to get my life back, and to return to my parkour practice stronger 
            than I'd ever been before.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I just turned 29 on April 2, and it made me realize that I had 1 more year to finish my list of "Before I'm 30" goals. On the 
            night of my birthday, I hatched a scheme that was so crazy it was kind of scary. And that's just the sort of challenge I'm excited 
            to try. I'd done the #100DaysOfCode challenge popular in the self-taught dev community. Twice. I loved that sort of timeboxed challenge 
            that seems doable but difficult. So I came up with this 365-day-long challenge where I won't eat any food with added sugar.
        </p>

            I'm going to continue to update this blog with entries about how it's going. My aim is to make 1 
            entry per day, so I can process any feelings or thoughts I have day-to-day and spot trends in hindsight 
            later on. With that, onwards and upwards! üöÄ

            Today was a little <i>too</i> easy. I'm not sure, maybe it's the initial burst of motivation 
            that always comes with a new challenge! But I didn't have to work hard at all to eat the right foods and 
            I had tons of energy!
