            Lost a little overnight, probably something to do with the workout & calorie deficit. Somehow I'm still fighting 
            this cold but I felt good enough to go into work today. Was sneezing half the time, but my team was kind about it. I 
            felt the congestion & cough getting worse toward the end of the day so I'm not sure what that's gonna mean for tomorrow. I 
            didn't work out today because by the time I wanted to, my symptoms were starting to get annoying. Figured that was a sign to 
            cool it a little on the cardio. And my biceps are still sore from my curls & dips yesterday so any arm stuff I wanted to do 
            was out of the question.

            Ended up in a calorie surplus today because I wanted some cheese curds at the end of the day. But at work, I had a salad and 2 pizza 
            slices. So, at least I had my veggies? lol I didn't see many options by the time I checked the cafe at 1:30 so that's where the pizza came 
            from. Oh well, not every day can be perfect, but maybe next time I'll just have a 2nd salad.

            Hoping for the best tomorrow regarding my cold. Worst case, I'll take a sick day and maybe clean up this blog a little. The "posts" folder is 
            getting pretty bloated with 26 files in it and I could probably split each post out into its own subpage. From the sound of the cough I had before 
            bed, it's feeling like I'm not gonna love tomorrow.
