            Today was pretty hard. I had to say no to a great gift from Sam's sister because of this 
            challenge. She was understanding about it, but I love gummi peach rings and she got me 2 bags 
            of them for Easter. I guess if you don't have to make hard choices, it isn't really a challenge, 
            is it?

            Other than that, I've been happily eating the snacks I got myself from Target the other day. Sam and I 
            ordered Pizza Hut for dinner and we chose a <a target='_blank' class='text-cyan-500' href='https://www.nutritionix.com/i/pizza-hut/super-supreme-large-original-pan-slice/23cb6838729fc48d4e4397c5'>
            Supreme</a> and some <a target='_blank' class='text-cyan-500' href='https://www.nutritionix.com/i/pizza-hut/breadsticks/23cb59550d24c2d85219268d'>breadsticks</a>. 
            There's admittedly some sugar in those but it's like 10g altogether, which is minuscule considering how many calories they are 
            overall.

            Tomorrow's back to the work week, which means my workouts start up again. It'll be interesting to see if 
            I drop below 233 by the end of the week or if I keep the small gains I've made instead. First week down, only 
            51 more to go! I'm proud I've made it this far already. Hasn't felt like a week. Benefits of being almost 30, I 
            suppose. As we age, time seems to go faster. Makes it easier to stick to stuff like this, I think.
