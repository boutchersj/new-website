            Today I went on an insane mountain bike ride up a lot of hills! My body isn't used to that sort of thing, 
            mostly because I've never gone mountain biking before. But this is what happens when you work at Trek. 
            When I got home, I was exhausted and a little peckish, which is why I decided it was time for me to stock up 
            on some no-added-sugar snacks that I'd be excited to eat, and which I didn't have to cook. This would stop me from 
            going to Culver's on a whim for some cheese curds, or something like that.

            I was heavier today than I was yesterday. But, I also ran out of bread yesterday, and I think eating a bunch of bread 
            and butter was causing me to enter a surplus the last couple of days. It's 110 calories per slice, plus 100 calories per 
            tablespoon of butter, and each time I ate this for a snack, I'd have 2 slices and 2 tbsp of butter. So, 420 calories 2-3x 
            per day means 840-1260 calories on top of whatever else I ate for meals. Probably not something I'll be doing again soon.

            When I went to the store to get snacks today, I bought rice cakes, dill pickle spears, cream cheese, natural organic crunchy 
            peanut butter, Bubly sparkling water (0 cal, no sweeteners), Ketola (Keto-friendly granola), and Rx Bars (Chocolate Lover's variety 
            pack). I also got some kettle chips, butter popcorn, and Bagel Bites for a movie night my wife and I were having. Not the same level of 
            quality in terms of nutritional value, but still no added sugar! Technically, the Bagel Bites & a small snack size bag of chips I had 
            earlier in the day had ~2g of added sugar per serving, but altogether it's 12g for the day, which is insignificant. This is where the 
            "use your judgement" part of this challenge somes in.

            They made a good substitute for food I might have bought out at a fast food restaurant, and cost significantly less for much more food. 
            I'm still feeling good, hoping eating these snacks as substitutes will start to show up in my energy levels and on the scale in the next week.
