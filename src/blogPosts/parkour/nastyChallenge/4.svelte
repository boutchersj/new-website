            I've taken to eating bread & butter as a snack and that might be influencing my weigh-in a bit. 
            I realized I'm going to need to start having some high-protein snacks and no-cook options in the house now 
            that I can't just go out and get a sugary snack whenever I want, and most of the fast food options I crave are now 
            things I can't have. Oof.

            I had some veggies at work today so that helped, but I think the extra mile in the morning really kicks up my appetite 
            and unless I eat high-protein or high-fiber options all day, I end up eating myself into a surplus. As far as staying away from 
            sugar goes, I think it's still pretty easy to do. I haven't had too many sources of temptation. One thing I noticed that's replacing 
            the sugary foods is running to get fried fast foods like cheese curds or chicken nuggets. Those aren't great, either. 
            I may need to start meal-prepping to make sure my snacks are better quality.
