        I started tracking my macros again today. I wasn't able to maintain my weight loss velocity 
        when I was just using a checklist approach. In fact, I stalled out for about a month and a half. So, 
        I'm being honest with myself, and I know that I do better at hitting my protein and fiber goals when I'm 
        counting my calories. I'm using MyFitnessPal again. The difference in my approach this time is I won't be 
        describing my food on this blog like I did last time I was tracking everything. I just find it less 
        stressful to keep these posts simple.
