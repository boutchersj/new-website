        A LOT to mention here...We had to put our eldest cat, Minnie, down today. This was a 
        low point for me. I caved and had a small Oreo Frappe from McDonald's and 
        a sugary lemonade from Olive Garden. I didn't feel like being on top 
        of things today. The events of the day were too sad. I even missed the swim I 
        was going to do at the YMCA today, despite having the day off today. On a brighter note, 
        Sam and I are going kayaking in Door County tomorrow, and we're stopping by our 
        favorite local bakery while we're there for some cherry pie. I'll likely have a small slice 
        because I consider it a special occasion whenever we make the trek out there, which isn't more 
        than once or twice a year. Regarding the swimming habit I've been forming, I 
        took a break from it for a week or so because I was starting to get a skin condition that I 
        thought might have been from the pool. The nurses at Trek think it's folliculitis, so I'm on antibiotics 
        for that now. My new swim goggles came in last week, and now that I'm pretty sure 
        I know what this is and it's not contagious, I'm planning to resume morning swims next week.
