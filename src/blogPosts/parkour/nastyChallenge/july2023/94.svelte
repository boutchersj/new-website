        I'm starting to see gains from the weighted squats already! I'm going to 
        guess that most of that is from correcting my form via 2 coaching sessions 
        with my strength coach. I'm correcting for my anterior pelvic tilt and keeping 
        my foot placement on my bad leg in sync with the good leg. I don't think I've hit 
        my max weight yet for squats, but today I did 2 sets of 115 followed by 1 set of 135. 
        On a side note, I've noticed some eardrum pain after swimming, so I'm going to start 
        doing some post-swim hygiene stuff that the lifeguard recommended to me. Some way 
        to drain/dry out my ear canals after I'm out of the pool to prevent ear infections.
