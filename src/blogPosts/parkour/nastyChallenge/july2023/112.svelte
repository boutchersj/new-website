        Saturday didn't go so well nutritionally. I broke the 
        rules of the challenge and had a strawberry Frosty from Wendy's, and 
        a slice of cherry pie and a blueberry danish from Scaturo's bakery 
        in Sturgeon Bay. When I woke up and saw the scale today, I realized that 
        I couldn't even let grieving our cat sway me from the path I'm on because 
        it's too easy to reverse my progress. Beyond that, it just ruins my 
        mental clarity and physical energy levels to eat like that. One thing I'm 
        proud of, though, is that I didn't feel the need to have large servings of 
        anything, and I was eating the treats more slowly than I used 
        to. I do feel a sense of control over how I enjoy sugary foods 
        like that, but I don't think that'd hold up if I kept letting myself 
        have one of them every day. I don't regret having these snacks, but I think it's 
        wise to get back on the horse now.
