        Yesterday, my buddy told me that he barely recognized me! He hasn't seen me in person since before I started 
        this challenge, so it felt good to know the difference in my weight has shown up in my physical appearance! I'm 
        not sure I've noticed that difference as much because I'm always looking at myself and so is my wife, but if I go 
        back to a photo of me a year ago, I think I can see what he means. Just means it's working!
