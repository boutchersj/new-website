            I didn't work out or do PT again, because I'm still 
            coughing a lot. I did a little more of the on-the-couch PT stuff where I'll stand up & sit down slowly to 
            try to work the squatting chain. It feels challenging enough where I might just want to make a habit out of doing that 
            when I'm not doing a full PT workout.

            Another day of 2 big meals and a couple small snacks. I'm seeing yesterday's surplus on the scale, but today's surplus was only about 500 calories, and 
            I've seen that not be a problem in recent days, so we'll see tomorrow. Today I had a Panda Express meal & 5/8 of a frozen pizza, plus some toast with guacamole 
            or butter. I made sure to hit my protein goal & get some quality grains & non-starchy green veggies.

            I'm hoping I'm at the peak of this cold now. Feels like the only thing it can do at this point is move to my chest or start 
            to recede entirely.
