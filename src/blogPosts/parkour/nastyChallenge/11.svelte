            Today went pretty well! Still holding the streak. Only thing is I didn't do any exercise. Reason being, 
            I didn't want to risk aggravating my knee which was inflamed yesterday from a hard landing. It felt better by the 
            end of the day, but I'm sure another night's rest will help it out even more.

            The only not-great food choice I made was getting chicken strips & ched'r peppers from Sonic for a post-dinner 
            snack. But the rest of the day, it was the healthy no-sugar-added snacks I've been eating the past few days. I worked from 
            home, so no salad, but I did try rice cakes with a cottage cheese & cream cheese blend, and it was stellar. I definitely 
            love that I can have the creaminess of cream cheese + the protein of cottage cheese.
