            I had 2 large meals today, one in the late morning at Tropical Smoothie Cafe, and another in the 
            early evening at Red Lobster. Came in at over 1300 calories beyond my calorie goal, which seems like a lot, 
            but I didn't really feel super full at any point during the day. I can see my surplus from yesterday showed up 
            on the scale, but not too much. I've pretty much stabilized around 228-230 this week.

            I'm still sick, but on the mend. Mostly congestion & cough today, with a side of headaches. I read online that you 
            burn more calories when sick, even if you don't have a fever. I guess that might've contributed to me being so hungry today. 
            I didn't work out except a bike ride across town to Walgreens and then Woodman's to get some odds and ends. I like being 
            able to use my bike for small errands instead of my car. Especially on days I don't feel well enough to work out & do PT. And 
            I suppose I tried to do some "bare minimum" PT exercises on my couch, standing up and squatting down, and extending my leg while sitting.

            Really really hope I kick this thing soon. I tend to get sinus infections whenever I get congested, so if that happens, I'll be battling this 
            for another week or 2.
