            I had another success day! Today I ate a Mooyah burger like yesterday, same one, double hot bacon jam 
            cheeseburger. I'm pretty sure sugar's gotta be used in the caramelization process, but I wasn't able to find 
            any nutrition facts about that particular burger, and I know from caramelizing onions that it can't be that much 
            sugar, so...I just decided it's a safe bet.

            I didn't have anything else today with added sugar. In fact, today I 
            bought some sugar-free honey mustard to use for dipping and cooking. I LOVE honey mustard so I was surprised to see 
            it offered by the same brand as the sugar-free stir fry sauce I got. And it's tasty! I used it on the baked potato rounds 
            we had with our kale & gouda sandwiches tonight (EveryPlate meal).

            Earlier in the morning and afternoon, I had some cottage cheese 
            and Rx bars again. I'm running low on variety with my snacks, and I like what I like. And along with the honey mustard, at the grocery 
            store, I also got rice cakes and some salt & vinegar kettle chips. The rice cakes'll give me something to put peanut butter on. I'm trying to 
            avoid buying bread because I tend to eat too much of it at once.

            I was pretty shocked by my weight on the scale this morning. I haven't been under 230 since September 2021. That's a full 
            year-and-a-half personal best! I haven't worked out in 3 days now, though. I should go for a run and do PT work tomorrow now that 
            my knee's feeling back to a normal state. Overall, still going strong! I don't think it's good for me to be taking 3 days off from all 
            exercise in a row, though, now that I'm working out 4 days per week instead of 5 or 6. I'll just need to be more careful not to agitate my knee 
            because this is a direct consequence of doing that.
