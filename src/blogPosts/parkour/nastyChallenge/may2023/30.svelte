            Went down again! I don't really know what my calorie count looked like today because the 
            2 lunch meals I ate had ingredients I couldn't guess at. So I didn't really log much. I 
            knew what to log for my lunch salad and the EveryPlate and McDonald's meals I ate at dinner. In 
            any case, I ate a lot of food today. But that's because I had a lot of exercise!

            I trialed a new workout with my strength coach, so that got me a little sweaty. But then 
            immediately afterward, I tried my first yoga class at Trek. It wasn't a slow, relaxing one, either. 
            I was sweating more than anyone in there -- hyperhydrosis, I have it -- for the first 20 minutes, but 
            thankfully the last half was more focused on flexibility & mobility. And finally, I did my PT. No running 
            or cardio, though.

            I'm not sure how the scale's gonna react to all that mixed news tomorrow, but I'm sure it'll somewhat 
            balance out.
