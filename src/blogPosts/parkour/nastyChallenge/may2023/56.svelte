    otherThoughts={`
        Based on my weigh-in today and how I was feeling last night, I'm pretty sure eating white bread and black beans 
        gives me some level of digestive dysfunction. I'm not sure how or why, but I think avoiding those 2 foods is 
        probably going to help me feel better, if not reduce inflammation and continue losing weight.
