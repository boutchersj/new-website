            Today was a work-from-home again! I had a Starbucks cold brew with milk and an order of kale & mushroom sous vide 
            egg bites...and then I didn't eat again til the end of the day LOL. So, not great, but I didn't really feel hungry around 
            lunch time. I went to the store after dinner to grab a couple of high-protein no-added-sugar frozen meals to make up for lost 
            calories. I had a feeling 1100 wasn't adequate for a whole day.

            Before I went to the store, I rode my bike for 10 minutes, did my PT, ran a mile, and did some farmer walks with kettlebells, just to kickstart my activity 
            level again. I felt pretty great after that, lots of mental clarity. The downside was I woke up around 3 and slept on-and-off for 
            the remainder of the night. Somehow I still felt great when I woke up the next day and didn't crash at all (I'm writing this on the 18th).

            Weight is up again today. Not surprised because of how I ate yesterday. But given how little I ate today I'm probably going to see a dip tomorrow. 
            I'm very excited to get my InBody scan on Thursday! My nutritionist is coming to the Trek office to do the scans and I signed up for a slot. I'm curious 
            to see what's changed in my overall composition since I started making changes this year.
