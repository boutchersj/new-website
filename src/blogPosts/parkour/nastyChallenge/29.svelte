            I think I had a calorie deficit today! The dinner recipe I made from EveryPlate had mayonnaise in it, and 
            we didn't have any, so I used a workaround. Instead of having raw coleslaw, I cooked it with a tablespoon of butter. 
            Strictly by the numbers, I was about 200 over today, but I also don't really know the recipe for the shepherd's pie or 
            buffalo veggie burger I ate at work today. My weigh-in's still stabilized in the 228-231 range. We'll see if it goes down 
            this week.

            I did my PT in the morning before work. Did 4 sets of 5 band-assisted pull-ups at work. Didn't do much else for physical 
            activity. I feel about 95% cured of the cold I had all of last week. Looking like this week's going to go pretty well! We have 
            to start paying for food at work for the first time since the pandemic hit, but it's only $5/day, so I'm definitely still using the 
            food options they have to supplement what I eat at home.

            The blog got an update yesterday! Now I have the posts separated by calendar month, and split off from the main blog page. I think this 
            will help keep that main page from getting bloated. It also leaves room for anything else parkour-related I want to blog about. Hope it wasn't 
            too hard finding this post!
