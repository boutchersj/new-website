        <p>
            Finished the day 198 calories under goal. Ate plenty of protein & fiber, some broccoli & chicken. 
            It was a good food day. I got my workout, PT, and bike ride in, so, another power hour in the books. I 
            don't have much to say other than that! I think my weight gain could be either due to the refined grains or 
            the calorie surplus or both from yesterday. Tomorrow has the potential to have a better weigh-in!
