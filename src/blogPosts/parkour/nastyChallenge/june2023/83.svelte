        I finally beat the plateau! I was stuck above 220 for the whole month of June. Just hit 
        under 220 today! Very excited about this. That's officially 35 lbs lost since May 15, 2022. It's 
        also 25 pound lost in the last 6 months. The majority of my weight loss has happened this year!
