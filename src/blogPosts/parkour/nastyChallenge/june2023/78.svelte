        My shoulder was aggravated a little bit today, so I stayed off of it for my strength training. Mentally, I was 
        prepared to do a lot more, but it was going to be stuff that engaged my shoulder. My knee was also irritated today. I wasn't 
        able to do as many box jumps as I normally can, or as many barbell squats. Feels like I need a full day of no exercise, some rest, 
        and some ice.
