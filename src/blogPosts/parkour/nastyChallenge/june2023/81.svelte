        In the morning, I got set up with an EGYM account at the YMCA. This is going to 
        allow me to do circut training on weight machines without having to plan workouts. It 
        comes free with my YMCA membership. I'm still going to do free weight stuff but this is 
        a nice addition to my arsenal of strength training options.
