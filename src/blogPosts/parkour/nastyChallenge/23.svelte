            I came in over calorie goal today by about 750 calories. Not too bad, considering I also 
            started working out again with my power hour today. I was finally feeling good enough to get a 
            workout & PT in. I'm still working from home so I don't get my coworkers sick.

            One fun food thing I did was invest in some keto-friendly plant-protein-heavy tortillas, salsa, and shredded 
            Mexican cheese. I used to have salsa & cheese wraps all the time when I came home from high school. It's a 
            familiar snack to me. The special tortillas are more expensive than the cheese but it's still pretty cheap considering 
            how many days it lasts me. Next time I go to the grocery store, I'm going to grab some onions & bell peppers I can 
            chop up to put in them.

            I'll admit overall, today was pretty gluten-heavy. Bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit in the morning, flatbread at lunch, and 
            flatbread again at dinner. Probably gonna show up on the scale tomorrow due to inflammation. But at least I hit my protein goal 
            for the day!
