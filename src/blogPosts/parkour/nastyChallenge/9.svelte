            Another day without added sugar! Yay! Since it was Taco Tuesday at Trek today, I got a burrito bowl from the 
            build-your-own hot lunch station. I didn't have a salad, but that means I'll have one tomorrow! My arm workout felt 
            more difficult today, and I'm pretty sure that's because I skipped it on Friday. That means the last time I did it was 
            a week ago. After work, I got some more no-added-sugar snacks, including a <a target='_blank' class='text-cyan-500' href='https://www.nutritionix.com/i/wonderworks/cereal-keto-friendly-peanut-butter/5fff0111782bbbc57462850b'>
            keto-friendly peanut butter cereal</a>, which I'm enjoying more than the Ketola granola snack I bought last week.

            I was also shocked by the 3-pound drop in weight after remaining steady over the weekend! It seems possible that I'll break into 
            the 220s in the next week or 2. I found a Healthline article that explains what my nutritionist has been telling me about 
            how excess added sugar consumption leads to higher fat storage. <a target='_blank' class='text-cyan-500' href='https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/does-sugar-make-you-fat#:~:text=summary%20high%2Dsugar%20diets%20contribute%20to%20prolonged%20elevated%20blood%20sugar%2C%20insulin%20resistance%2C%20and%20leptin%20resistance%20%E2%80%94%20all%20of%20which%20are%20linked%20to%20weight%20gain%20and%20excess%20body%20fat'>

            I think I'm starting to enjoy finding the no-added-sugar option among a selection of foods available to me. I definitely have more energy 
            to exercise every day, which has resulted in me being able to recover from my scheduled workout and a couple cardio sessions without any issues. 
            That coupled with the clear weight loss benefits I'm seeing so far is really encouraging for me.
