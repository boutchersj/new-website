            Another day of no added sugar! Today, I went into work early so I could 
            do 10 minutes on the recumbent bike, my PT exercises, and then run a mile. 
            I didn't do any other exercise the rest of the day, but I definitely felt more 
            clear-headed and energized because of that "power hour". I still need to schedule 
            another meeting with my strength coach to level-set & modify my workout.

            I'm tracking my calories again so I may cut the food segment from these posts unless 
            there's something pertinent to how I'm feeling or relates to the sugar gram count for the 
            day. I might just talk about my calorie count for the day. My weigh-in, on the other hand, 
            is less than yesterday, and I'm thinking the cardio I'm doing is a nice buffer on days I go slightly 
            over on calories. Like yesterday, I went 500 over but came in lower on the scale today.

            Still going strong! I think my focus has shifted away from "playing not to lose" and on to 
            "playing to win". I'm starting to try to replace fried foods with better options now that sugar isn't 
            hard to avoid anymore. I think it'll only make me feel better throughout the day and give me more energy. I'm 
            also looking forward to what the InBody scan tomorrow says about the nature of my weight loss.
