            Another easy day! I started off with a frozen Crav'n breakfast meal before work and brought some SmartSweets candy to work with me. 
            Then, while at work, I had 2 Italian wraps and a salad with balsamic vinaigrette. A few cups of cold brew, too. 
            After work, I had some cheddar corn bisque.

            For exercise, I think I need to hit my personal trainer back up for a new regimen, because I don't see any more in the app.
             After work, I did something I'm calling a "Power Hour" where I go on a 10-minute bike ride, then do my PT for about 30 minutes, 
             and end with a 10-20-minute run. Did the same thing yesterday. Leaves me feeling super relaxed and clear-headed.

            Dropping weight again, which figures, because I didn't eat a whole lot yesterday and I did some cardio. The ease of staying away 
            from sugar at this point can be described as "auto-pilot". I'm not even upset about it anymore. I guess it's hard to miss a taste 
            on the tongue when I'm getting benefits like feeling wide awake at 5am, mental clarity all day, weight loss, and plenty of energy to 
            cook and socialize with the family at night. And anything I've missed as part of normal entree food, I've been able to substitute with 
            a no-sugar-added alternative. Not sure if this is a forever thing yet, but I think it can definitely be a year-long thing.
