            I did a lot of mountain biking today and crashed! Got a few cuts and bruises, nothing serious. I 
            aggravated my bad knee again, and that wasn't fun, but it should be fine again tomorrow. I've noticed 
            the flare-up doesn't last very long the last few times I've landed hard on it. But the good part about all 
            this biking is it was at least a solid hour of cardio and leg work because my "biking muscles" are not 
            accustomed yet to the climbs and jumps and all the fun that comes with riding in the woods.

            I ate a lot more than usual today, and honestly, I'm thinking it was all the biking that made me so hungry at the 
            end of the day. I'd considered just doing what I did yesterday and getting a pound of grass-fed beef and cooking it to 
            avoid all the excess carbs with alternative options, but my stomach really wanted a full spread. So we ordered Red Robin 
            and after a burger, steak fries, and 2 onion rings, I was content, but not overfull.

            This last meal of the day is one that I mention because it was 1,811 calories, which is more than I typically have now for 
            1 meal. It did have 72g of protein, but I went 1,769 calories over my daily goal because I didn't go for something smaller. That said, my daily goal is basal metabolic rate, and I definitely burned more than that today. Only the scale 
            knows if I broke even here, but I doubt it. One day's not a big deal.

            I was disappointed to find out after-the-fact that the MadLove burger I ordered from Red Robin tonight 
            had Island Heat sauce in it, which definitely contributed to it having 27g of sugar overall. Gonna bet that this technically breaks 
            the rules of the challenge, except for the fact that I didn't knowingly order a burger with sugar. That said, I should do better research 
            next time. I ordered a side of Island Heat sauce too before realizing I'd need to throw it away when it arrived because 1 dipping cup has 29g of 
            added sugar in it. It wasn't hard to throw it away. I was just being a little lazy when reading the nutrition facts sheet for the 
            restaurant because I was mostly concerned with optimizing for high protein.

            This challenge isn't one I get to walk away from if I accidentally consume sugar, though. I'm in it for the full 365 days. My philosophy is 
            getting back on the horse is always better. 365 imperfect days will always beat 100 perfect days followed by giving up. I think my choice not 
            to give up will work out for me in the end. It worked out well when I didn't restart #100DaysOfCode if I missed 1 day. Same logic applies here. 
            It's rewarding the process not the outcome.
