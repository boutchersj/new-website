            I managed to get through another day without too much difficulty! I've stopped tracking calories as of yesterday and I still lost 2.5 pounds. 
            I've been adding a 10-minute mile jog on the treadmill every morning this week, so that might be why. I'll probably skip Wednesday's 
            jog because it's my scheduled rest day for workouts during the week, so it'll be interesting to see if that does anything.

            I think what's going to be tough is repeated exposure to sugary foods and not getting to have any. Today, I brought my wife an ice cream 
            sandwich from the freezer. I didn't feel an overwhelming temptation to have one, but I could tell there was a part of me that would have liked to. 
            That voice will probably grow stronger as the days go on, but I think viewing this as a year-long thing helps.

            My wife brought up a valid point to me, though, that I'd probably regret not trying some new foods when we go to Canada in the fall. We're going to 
            travel a lot in our lives together, and there will be interesting food to try wherever we go, and it might be years before I ever see those options 
            again. That said, if I make it the full 6 months before that trip without having added sugar in my life, I'm gonna guess that I'd have experienced 
            a significant change in body composition by then. I'd probably allow it to be the "halftime show" of this year-long challenge, if only to be able to 
            experience new foods from another country with my wife. Then I could return to the challenge and finish out the 365 days.

            All that said, I've started writing these posts the morning after, because that way I can guarantee I'm not missing any details from the day. 
            One more thing I wanted to mention was I'd had more energy last night than I typically do! I even wanted to play a card game with Sam (my wife). 
            Usually I'm eager to fall asleep as soon as possible after we're doing with our evening routine. I have to wonder if eating less sugar had something 
            to do with that.
