            I took a day off from any exercise or PT because of the bike crash on Friday. The swelling went down 
            for the most part overnight, and I should be back to 100% tomorrow. Somehow my weigh-in's down from yesterday 
            even though I was almost 2000 calories over my limit yesterday. Not sure how that math works, but it's possible 
            I happened to lose a bunch of water weight overnight, too.

            Today was another big eating day, though not as big. The bacon potato corn chowder we made from scratch felt like it 
            had a lot more calories than it probably did, because it's so hearty. We have plenty of leftovers even after I had 2 bowls 
            and Sam had 1. It'll be interesting to see how that shows up on the scale tomorrow, especially since I felt some brain fog by 
            the end of the day. It could've been the food but I'm gonna guess my body's still recovering from yeseterday also.

            Sam introduced me to a place called Tropical Smoothie Cafe tonight and I love that they offer sugar substitutes and 
            naturally sweetened smoothies with no added sugar. I had one and it wasn't the most flavorful thing in the world but it 
            was naturally sweetened, so that sorta makes sense. I'd have another one.
